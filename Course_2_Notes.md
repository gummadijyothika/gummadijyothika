# Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions 📊

## Key Learning Objectives
- Define the "Ask" phase of the data analysis process.
- Use **SMART** questioning to refine business goals.

---

## 💡 The SMART Framework
* **S**pecific: Does the question address a specific problem?
* **M**easurable: Can the answer be tracked with numbers?
* **A**ction-oriented: Will the answer lead to a change?
* **R**elevant: Does this solve a real business problem?
* **T**ime-bound: Is there a specific timeframe?

### Practice Example:
**Vague Question:** "How do we get more customers?"
**SMART Question:** "Which marketing channel (Email vs. Social Media) resulted in the highest conversion rate for new users in Q1 2026?"

## 🏗️ Case Study: From Vague Request to SMART Question
*This section demonstrates my ability to translate business needs into actionable data goals.*

**The Business Problem:** A manager wants to "sell more organic milk" but doesn't know where to start.

**My Analysis:**
* **Vague Question:** "How can we sell more milk?"
* **My SMART Question:** "What was the percentage increase in organic milk sales compared to regular milk sales in the last 30 days at our Downtown location?"

**Why this works:**
It is **Specific** (Organic vs. Regular), **Measurable** (Percentage), **Action-oriented** (Informs inventory decisions), **Relevant** (Solves the manager's goal), and **Time-bound** (Last 30 days).
